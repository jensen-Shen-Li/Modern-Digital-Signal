## Installation

The code requires `python>=3.8`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

Install Segment Anything:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
```

or clone the repository locally and install with

```
git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
cd segment-anything; pip install -e .
```

The following optional dependencies are necessary for mask post-processing, saving masks in COCO format, the example notebooks, and exporting the model in ONNX format. `jupyter` is also required to run the example notebooks.

```
pip install opencv-python pycocotools matplotlib onnxruntime onnx
```
### Web demo

The `demo/` folder has a simple one page React app which shows how to run mask prediction with the exported ONNX model in a web browser with multithreading. Please see [`demo/README.md`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything/blob/main/demo/README.md) for more details.

## <a name="Models"></a>Model Checkpoints

Three model versions of the model are available with different backbone sizes. These models can be instantiated by running

```
from segment_anything import sam_model_registry
sam = sam_model_registry["<model_type>"](checkpoint="<path/to/checkpoint>")
```

Click the links below to download the checkpoint for the corresponding model type.

- **`default` or `vit_h`: [ViT-H SAM model.](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth)**
- `vit_l`: [ViT-L SAM model.](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_l_0b3195.pth)
- `vit_b`: [ViT-B SAM model.](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth)

## RUN

```
python train.py
```


## Dataset

See [here](https://ai.facebook.com/datasets/segment-anything/) for an overview of the datastet. The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://ai.facebook.com/datasets/segment-anything-downloads/). By downloading the datasets you agree that you have read and accepted the terms of the SA-1B Dataset Research License.

We save masks per image as a json file. It can be loaded as a dictionary in python in the below format.

```python
{
    "image"                 : image_info,
    "annotations"           : [annotation],
}

image_info {
    "image_id"              : int,              # Image id
    "width"                 : int,              # Image width
    "height"                : int,              # Image height
    "file_name"             : str,              # Image filename
}

annotation {
    "id"                    : int,              # Annotation id
    "segmentation"          : dict,             # Mask saved in COCO RLE format.
    "bbox"                  : [x, y, w, h],     # The box around the mask, in XYWH format
    "area"                  : int,              # The area in pixels of the mask
    "predicted_iou"         : float,            # The model's own prediction of the mask's quality
    "stability_score"       : float,            # A measure of the mask's quality
    "crop_box"              : [x, y, w, h],     # The crop of the image used to generate the mask, in XYWH format
    "point_coords"          : [[x, y]],         # The point coordinates input to the model to generate the mask
}
```
